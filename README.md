# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Homework #2.1 - Bootstrap version

Style Notes: 

1) I decided to use the toggle hiding the navigation links on smaller devices rather then having them stack becasue I thought it looked alot better.  

2) Instead of having everything left justified, I chose to center everything as screen size changes.

3) I chose to omit an H1 or Strong tag on the name in the header becasue I liked the small styling better -- looks more like brand logo.

4) On the profile page intead of putting setting the image and overlay to the same size, I chose to make the text overlay wider then the image in the column to give it more of a "Pop".

5) I decided to drop in a media query and some additional styling for the global nav on mobile. 

6) Form submit hover state color change.
